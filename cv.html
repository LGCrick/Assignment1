            <b>Personal Statement.</b>
            Currently I am studying a Bsc Computing degree at Northampton
            University. This course involves Software Engineering, Web
            Development, Computer Communications, programming and systems,
            Databases and problem solving. I am getting on very well with
            the course and hope to come out of the university having received
            a first.

            <b>Hobbies.</b>
            My hobbies include a range of physical activities such as
            swimming and going to the gym as well as video gaming and
            playing cards. I like to maintain a healthy balance between
            sitting at a desk and keeping fit.

            <b>COFFEE CORNER.</b>
            I worked part time at COFFEE CORNER during my time at Luton
            Sixth Form College whilst doing my A-Level studies. The job
            required me to regularly serve and make conversation with
            customers and build relationships with the public. It greatly
            improved my team leading skills and discipline within the work
            place. <I>Reference available</I>

            <b>DOMINOES.</b>
            I worked at Dominoes as a delivery driver during my time at Northampton University
            in order to keep a stable income to support my parents,
            and bolster my personal savings during university. This allowed
            me to grow individually and be independent of my parents
            as well as improve my experience in the world and consolidate
            my time management skills.

            <b>Interests.</b>
            From a very young age I have been very interested in all
            types of music and often enjoy mainstream and classical
            concerts. I am a big fan of video games and a strong
            supporter of many E-Sport organisations. My favourite
            video game is DotA 2 of which I enjoy playing competitvely
            and casually with friends.

          <p>
            <b>Practical Skills.</b>
            Over the series of my education I have gathered a
            wide range of skills such as the ability to take charge
            and lead a team as well as complete work on time to a
            professional standard. I have the ability to work both
            day and night shifts with little to no adjustment time.
            I have a strong work ethic and a desire to prove my abilities
            in any line of work.
