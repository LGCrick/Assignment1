            'Born in luton, 4th February 1998 Leon√© is the first child to his parents Graham and Elsa
            and only brother to his sister Elise-Marie'. Graham's household is one of the smaller
            branches in our extended family tree, where the Italian tradition of large immediate
            families has worn thin- there has often been talk of a new distant relative born overseas.
            Our house is filled with a vibrant range of personalities; Graham is stern and calculated
            outside, the head of the house who likes to keep it in military order, often mistaken by
            many as 'scary' deep down Graham was nothing but soft inside, always wanting the best for
            family but struggling to let go and let us make mistakes. Elsa was a hyper-confusing mix
            relaxed and stressed where she could often prove herself to be capable of teaching 30
            children ICT before coming home and failing to realise that laptops need to be charged
            before you can turn them on, she is hardworking most of the time and the rest of the time
            she seemingly just succeeds by luck. Elise is what i would refer to as a 'panic-er' often
            worried by things she's over prepared for and quick to lose satisfaction from an achievment.

            I myself am often told i care far to little for the real world, seemingly always caught up
            in my own mind, i find a lot of joyful solitude in the six square metres of my home bedroom.
            It's not that i lack the ability to interact with other people, anyone would be the first to
            tell you i could talk too much to anyone who wants to listen, but i just simply prefer to spend
            my time alone with my own mind. I suppose it stems from being trapped in my own subjective
            experience of reality where the only proof there is to me that i'm not the only conscious
            entity in the universe, is trust.

            I suppose really to explain me best the only word i could think to use would simply be complacent.
            Things don't tend to bother me when they go wrong, they just get fixed or forgotten. My attitude
            probably stems from a friend who made a series of statements that have never left my mind.
            "Is there a problem? Yes, Can it be fixed? Yes, No problem. Can it be fixed? No, no further problem
            then."
