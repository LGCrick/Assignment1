Development and originality- The website started out as a few ideas that I put down into atom, simplistic styling has always been something I liked so I wanted to make sure the pages weren't overcrowded but all information was straight there to see. I followed the guidelines closely at first, ignoring only the fact that the CSS stylings were to go into a separate folder. This allowed me to style pages quickly individually and find a look that I felt pleased the eye. following this after finishing my first none home page. I took the navigation bar from that one and moved it into the styles.css file. this meant that I could keep a 'house style' across each of my pages making the site familiar to users. This also made media queries much easier to organise as I wouldn't need to write them individually for each of the pages. I checked the queries in Chrome often because they don't work within the atom previewer but behave as expected in chrome.
In the project took me approximately 8 hours before Christmas, spent gathering ideas and putting down odd elements into atom and then between 3 and 4 hours each on 6 separate days after Christmas actually working towards a clear goal. After the site was completed it took a further 4 hours to polish the code and check all links. total time was around 32hours from the first idea to the final product.
